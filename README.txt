.txt and .htm files lead to a lot of compressions. This is because the total percent compression
is 40% for them while it was 18% for others. Files like images (.tif) had very little compression.
This is because when you look at the frequencies of the images there are a lot of colors that are
similar so there is not much variation between the frequencies and thus the codes. The huffman
algorithm works really well when the character huffman codes are small, which is when there is a lot
of variation on the frequencies and the differences are really big. When you recompress a file that
is already compressed the results differ based on the type of file. For the CIA Factbook, it
recompressed and saved more bits. For an image it throws a force compression error, also the
image becomes blurry when you zoom in as it is a lossy compression.
